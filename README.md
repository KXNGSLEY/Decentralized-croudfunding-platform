🚀 Crowdfunding NFT Smart Contract
Overview
This Solidity smart contract enables decentralized crowdfunding with NFT rewards. Users can contribute funds to a campaign, and in return, they receive unique NFTs as proof of their contribution. The contract is designed with security, transparency, and efficiency in mind, leveraging OpenZeppelin libraries and best practices.

🔑 Features
✅ Secure & Transparent – Uses OpenZeppelin’s Ownable, ReentrancyGuard, and ERC721URIStorage for protection.
✅ NFT Rewards – Contributors receive NFTs as proof of their funding.
✅ Fundraising Goals – Campaigns have set funding targets and deadlines.
✅ Withdrawal Protection – Funds are only released to the campaign creator if the goal is met.
✅ Automatic Refunds – If a campaign fails, contributors can withdraw their funds.
✅ Gas Optimization – Uses efficient Solidity practices to reduce transaction costs.

🛠 Tech Stack
Solidity (Smart contract development)
OpenZeppelin (Security and contract standards)
Hardhat/Remix (Development & testing)
Ethereum / Polygon / BSC (Compatible networks)
📜 Smart Contract
The contract allows campaign creators to set a funding goal and a deadline. Users can contribute ETH (or another blockchain-native currency), and if the goal is met, the creator can withdraw the funds. If the goal is not met, contributors can claim refunds. Each contributor also receives a unique ERC-721 NFT as proof of their support.

💻 Installation & Deployment
1️⃣ Install Dependencies
If you're using Hardhat, run:

bash
Copy
Edit
npm install @openzeppelin/contracts dotenv
2️⃣ Compile the Contract
bash
Copy
Edit
npx hardhat compile
3️⃣ Deploy to a Testnet (e.g., Sepolia, Goerli)
Modify the hardhat.config.js with your Alchemy/Infura API Key and Private Key, then run:

bash
Copy
Edit
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network goerli
4️⃣ Verify the Contract on Etherscan
bash
Copy
Edit
npx hardhat verify --network goerli <DEPLOYED_CONTRACT_ADDRESS>
🔒 Security Considerations
Implements ReentrancyGuard to prevent reentrancy attacks.
Uses Ownable to restrict sensitive functions to the contract owner.
Ensures NFT metadata is immutable post-minting.
Follows Solidity best practices for gas optimization.
